## Description
Scenario: Product Management System
In this scenario, you need to create
a system that manages the information of different products. 
This system includes various features for storing, 
retrieving and displaying product information. 
Product information is displayed as objects in Java,
and these objects must be able to be serialized and deserialized. 
In this system, different types of serialization including default serialization, 
custom serialization and externalization will be used. Also, 
PrintWriter and PrintStream are used to print and display product 
information to various outputs (such as console and file).
